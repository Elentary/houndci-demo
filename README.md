### Convention

Defining and sticking with a style guide helps reduce the amount of decisions that developers need to make when writing code, helping to keep their focus on logic, not semantics and formatting.

### Consistency

When every line of code is written in the same style, the whole codebase becomes easier to read, understand and de-bug. It also helps prevent areas of the codebase from being "owned" by one person's unique style vs. the team.

### Awesomeness

A clean codebase is a reflection of a cohesive team. It gives the impression of a team working well together towards a common goal, rather than individual developers working independently.
